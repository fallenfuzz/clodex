// Per-session serialized PTY injection with a typing quiet-gate.
//
// Why this exists: an injection is Ctrl-U (clear line) + text + a settle delay +
// Enter. The Ctrl-U and the Enter used to be a synchronous write and a *deferred*
// setTimeout with nothing guarding the gap — so two near-simultaneous injections
// (an operator app-panel message and a DM delivery, say) interleaved: the second
// item's Ctrl-U+text landed between the first's text and its Enter, splicing one
// message mid-word into the other (observed live twice). Serializing every
// injection through one per-session chain makes each Ctrl-U→Enter an atomic unit.
//
// The quiet-gate is the second half: the leading Ctrl-U destroys an operator's
// un-submitted draft even with perfect serialization. So before starting an
// item, the drainer waits out a short window since the last human keystroke,
// capped by a max-wait so a walked-away draft can't starve deliveries forever
// (the cap falls back to today's inject-anyway behavior — never worse than
// before). Applies to EVERYTHING, self-intents included: no injection is so
// urgent that eating the operator's draft is correct.
//
// Deliberately dependency-injected (write / timers / clocks / predicates) so the
// serialization and the gate are unit-testable without a live PTY or Electron.

// Gap between the leading Ctrl-U (clear-line) write and the text write. EMPIRICAL
// (Claude Code 2.1.205, verified live): a LONE '\x15' written on its own — with a
// short gap before the text — registers as a clear-line KEY event (the CLI shows
// its "Ctrl+Y to paste deleted text" kill-ring hint and the draft vanishes). The
// OLD single-chunk write of '\x15'+text was read as ONE paste-like input event,
// which left the '\x15' as a LITERAL char in the buffer (it never cleared
// anything, and merged into an open draft). The gap is what makes the CLI's input
// loop process the key before the text arrives; ~30ms is comfortably enough.

// Pure predicate for the compact in-flight guard: a self-compact is "in flight"
// while its guard is armed OR its continuation is still stashed (awaiting the
// summary). A duplicate [agent:context compact] landing in that window must be
// dropped rather than injected — a second /compact collides with the first
// mid-compaction ("Connection closed mid-response"). Extracted here purely so
