#
#   docker/run.sh [build|up|down|reset|logs|ssh|host]
#
# The image (see Dockerfile) bakes Clodex + all deps + a pre-enabled service, so
# 'up' brings up a peer already answering on 127.0.0.1:7900 — no cold deploy.
# 'up' runs the container with reduced caps + host cgroups (see below), maps SSH
# to host port 2222, and authorizes ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub. After it's up:
#   1) docker/run.sh host      # prints an ~/.ssh/config block to paste
#   2) Mac Clodex -> Peers -> Add peer -> ssh host = clodex-docker -> connect
#      (Test & Set Up re-runs the deploy = a fast git fetch/reset + restart)
#   3) authenticate the agent CLIs once: docker exec -it -u clodex clodex-peer \
#      bash -lc 'claude'   (then OAuth); same for `codex login`.
#
# The agent CLIs' auth dirs (~/.claude, ~/.codex) live in PERSISTENT named volumes
# (clodex-peer-claude / clodex-peer-codex), so that one-time OAuth survives
# up/down/rebuild — you don't re-auth every time. 'down' keeps the volumes;
# 'reset' wipes them (forces a fresh OAuth).

    # NOT --privileged, and NOT --cap-add SYS_ADMIN. A self-run sandbox assessment
    # demonstrated that SYS_ADMIN alone is privileged-EQUIVALENT for escape here:
    # it permits mounting a cgroup-v1 hierarchy and writing `release_agent`, which
    # the kernel then runs as ROOT IN THE HOST VM's init namespace (the classic
    # release_agent escape) — reaching the Docker socket and /host_mnt/Users. The
    # default AppArmor that would normally deny that mount DOES NOT EXIST in the
    # LinuxKit VM, so there is no second line of defense. So we drop ALL caps and
    # add back only the handful a full systemd + dbus + sshd boot needs, none of
    # which enable the escape:
    #   SETUID/SETGID/SETPCAP  user switching + dbus dropping its own caps
    #   CHOWN/DAC_OVERRIDE/FOWNER  boot-time file ownership/permission fixups
    #   KILL                   systemd signalling services it doesn't uid-own
    #   NET_BIND_SERVICE       sshd binding privileged port 22
    #   SYS_CHROOT             sshd privilege-separation chroot("/run/sshd")
    # None of these re-open the escape: it needs SYS_ADMIN to mount a cgroup
    # hierarchy, and none of the above grant mount. (SYS_CHROOT only permits
    # chroot(), which can't mount or write cgroup release_agent.)
    # Electron's Chromium sandbox is the one thing that WANTED SYS_ADMIN (to build
    # its namespace sandbox in a container); the image runs it with --no-sandbox
    # instead (safe — Clodex already runs nodeIntegration+no-contextIsolation, so
    # that sandbox was never a boundary for it). See the Dockerfile service step.
    # Verified on Docker Desktop (LinuxKit, cgroup v2): systemd reaches running
    # with 0 failed units, the peer answers, and `mount -t cgroup` is denied.
    #
    # Intentionally NOT setting --security-opt no-new-privileges: it stops a process
    # from GAINING privileges via execve (setuid/file-caps stop taking effect), which
    # breaks the clodex NOPASSWD `sudo -n` deploy/update path (sudo is setuid-root).
    # Safe to omit here because SYS_ADMIN is absent from the cap bounding set, so
    # no_new_privs would add no escalation protection — the ceiling already provides
    # it. Accepted, understood gap.
