"""Compat shim over the `proxylab` package (mechanical split, 2026-06-11).

The implementation that used to live in this one ~4700-line file is now the
`proxylab/` package, cut along the original section banners (see
proxylab/__init__.py for the module list + import order). This shim keeps both
historical consumers working unchanged:

  * uvicorn logproxy:app            (start_proxy.sh)
  * import logproxy as lp           (test_warmth_store.py, ad-hoc drivers)

Attribute access is forwarded LAZILY (PEP 562 module __getattr__) to the
owning submodule, so globals that are REBOUND at runtime (_DB, _CANARY_LOADED,
_TOTALS_AT_START, env flags the tests flip) are always read live — they are
never copied into this namespace.

NOTE: ASSIGNING through the shim (`lp.X = v`) does NOT propagate to the
owning module — it would just shadow the lazy lookup here. Assign on the
owning module instead, e.g. `lp.warmth.WARMTH_LEDGER = False`.
