# --- prefix-warmth ledger (SQLite-backed, TWO-STATE) ---------------------------
# Records, per cached message-prefix, WHEN it was last stamped and at what TTL,
# so a separate consumer (statusline / hook / pinger / compact-strip) can answer
# "is this conversation's prefix still warm?" — something a per-session JSONL
# can't know, because warmth lives on the CONTENT-ADDRESSED prefix the backend
# caches, which a forked keep-alive ping shares but never writes back to the
# original session's transcript. So the proxy LEARNS it from response receipts
# and stores it here. (Persistence: proxylab.store — warmth rows are the
# GLOBAL-scope tenant there, keyed by prefix hash, shared across ports.)
#
# TWO-STATE SEMANTICS (2026-06-09 decision; replaces warm/cold/unknown): the
# expiry predicate IS the answer. warm = row exists AND expires_at > now;
# everything else is not-warm. Because the store is durable and stamps every
# response-confirmed cache event, absence ≈ expiry, so the compact-strip gate
# may act on absence without the old third 'unknown' state. The gates:
#   * ping  IFF warm   (anything else declines — never higher cost)
#   * strip IFF NOT warm ('cold'/'absent'); store 'error' or ledger 'off'
#     decline (can't judge -> take that gate's no-action path)
# warmth_state() still reports 'cold' (lapsed row not yet purged) vs 'absent'
# (no row) for OBSERVABILITY only — no gate distinguishes them.
#
# EXPIRY IS THE GC: correctness lives in the read predicate (expires_at > now),
# never in row deletion. The background sweep only reclaims disk space, with a
# generous slack, and may run late or never without changing any gate decision.
# (This deletes the old semantic sweeper, whose eager reaping at bare ttl erased
# the very cold-evidence the three-state compact gate needed — the bug that
# motivated the two-state redesign.)
