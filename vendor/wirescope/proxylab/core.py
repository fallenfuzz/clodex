"""proxylab core: process identity + the constants everything else builds on.

wirescope began as a throwaway capture proxy (#2873/#2874) and grew into the
lab's analytical forward-proxy: byte-verbatim forwarding with full capture,
billing receipts, prefix-warmth economics, keep-warm pinger/holds, request
transforms, and an app-agnostic subscriber push feed (SUBSCRIBERS.md).
Mission unchanged: FIND & PRICE CONTEXT WASTE; STAY NON-INTRUSIVE. The module
map + durable conclusions live in CLAUDE.md; launch via start_proxy.sh /
run_release.sh (never as a CLI background job).

This module owns the shared foundation and IMPORTS NOTHING from the package
(everyone may import core): UPSTREAM, LOG_DIR, the request counter, version
self-report, the shared httpx client, the /agent/<name>/ route regex, and
header hygiene (_HOP, _SECRET_HEADERS, _safe_headers).

Capture layout (one subdirectory per session):
  LOG_DIR/<session_id>/<seq>-<agent>-<role>-<model>-<ts>.request.json
  LOG_DIR/<session_id>/<seq>-...-.response.sse | .response.json
  LOG_DIR/<session_id>/_session.json   per-session running total
  LOG_DIR/_no-session/...              count_tokens + probes (carry no metadata)
  LOG_DIR/_totals.json                 global process-lifetime total
The session_id is parsed out of metadata.user_id (itself a JSON string). All
disk writes go through the writer thread — nothing on the byte path blocks.

Point a CLI at the proxy either way:
  - bare:   ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:<port>
  - routed: ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:<port>/agent/<name>/anthropic
            (codex: .../agent/<name>/openai) — <name> becomes the session's
            agent identity: dump filenames, /_status titles, subscriber routing.
