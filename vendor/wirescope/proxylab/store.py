"""The shared SQLite store: ONE file, ONE connection per process, owner scope.

Split out of warmth.py (2026-06-12) when "the warmth ledger's database" had
quietly become the persistence layer for five other modules. The rule now:

  THE STORE OWNS THE CONNECTION; EACH MODULE OWNS ITS TABLES.

A module declares its schema once at import time with `register_schema(...)`;
the store applies every registered schema when the connection first opens, and
applies late registrations immediately if it is already open — so module
import order never matters here, and no module ever creates another module's
tables. ALTER statements are treated as additive column migrations (failure =
column exists = fine); everything else must be IF-NOT-EXISTS-idempotent.

Current tenants (owner module -> tables):
  warmth -> warmth, session_head     meta -> session_meta
  hold   -> hold_state               pinger -> last_request
  subs   -> subscribers

WHY SQLite over Redis (2026-06-09, unchanged): stdlib + no daemon to babysit;
durable per-commit by default; no "store unreachable" runtime state to
mishandle now that ABSENCE TRIGGERS ACTION in the warmth gates. WAL +
busy_timeout make the one file safely shareable across proxy processes.
CREDENTIALS NEVER LAND HERE (standing rule) — bodies/hashes/timestamps only.

Two scopes live in the same file:
  * GLOBAL rows (warmth): keyed by content-addressed prefix hash, shared by
    every proxy port on the box by design — one ledger, not eight blind ones.
  * OWNER rows (holds, last-requests, subscribers, …): runtime state that
    belongs to THE proxy instance serving the session. Scoped by
    `owner = resolved LOG_DIR` so a scratch port never resurrects (or
    double-pings) the main proxy's sessions after a restart.
