# --- HOLD-WARM: user-armed keep-warm driver (/warm-cache <n>) ------------------
# The replay pinger answers HOW to keep a prefix warm (one /_ping); this answers
# WHEN. The user arms a session IN-BAND: the /warm-cache command's expanded
# prompt carries the sentinel below (session_id rides in free via metadata).
# The proxy arms an until-deadline, then INJECTS an echo instruction and lets
# the turn FORWARD upstream so the MODEL ITSELF speaks the ack (2026-06-10
# redesign — the earlier synthetic end_turn left an assistant message the next
# turn's model knew it never wrote, and fable kept flagging the whole skill as
# prompt injection; a genuinely model-generated ack makes the transcript
# self-consistent). Liveness is structural: only a live proxy can add the
# [wirescope] block, so the command file's tripwire (no block -> reply "proxy
# not active") needs no history-scoping caveats. A background asyncio task
# (the event loop owns _client, which _warm_session needs) then auto-pings
# each armed session whenever its WARM prefix nears expiry.
#
# Arming costs one normal turn (~a ping when the prefix is warm; a fresh cache
# write when cold — which IS the warmth the hold then maintains). That spend is
# user-initiated (typed /warm-cache), not autonomous, so the never-higher-cost
# principle doesn't gate it. WARMTH_HOLD defaults ON; each arm is an explicit
# user action, clamped to WARMTH_HOLD_MAX_HOURS with a ping-count backstop.
# Pings fire inside (0, MARGIN) seconds of expiry — never at the TTL edge (the
# documented TOCTOU guidance) — and _warm_session's own warm-only gate is the
# final arbiter. Ping economics (CLAUDE.md): ~19:1 at 1h TTL; a 5m prefix is a
# bad bet (~12 pings/h) — allowed but warned about in the arming ack.
