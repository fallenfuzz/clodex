# --- PINGER: keep a prefix warm by REPLAYING a session's last request ---------
# The old keep-warm path made a caller reconstruct an entire `--resume
# --fork-session` payload (tools, cwd, system, history) just to smuggle a
# sentinel turn past the proxy. But the proxy ALREADY sees the exact, fully
# transformed last request of every session — the precise bytes the backend
# content-addressed. So the dance collapses to: cache that last request in
# memory, and let `POST /_ping?session=<id>` replay it with thinking off and
# `max_tokens:1`. Identical cacheable prefix => a cache READ that slides the TTL,
# for ~1 output token. The caller only needs the session_id.
#
# The cache holds auth/version headers too (so the replay matches the original's
# beta namespace + credentials) — IN MEMORY ONLY, never written to disk.
