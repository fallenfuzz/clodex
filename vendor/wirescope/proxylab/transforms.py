# forwarder: the server skips the ENTIRE request-mutation chain (inject /
# shortcircuit / relocate / strip / wirescope omit+tools+hint / sort /
# compact-strip / hold-echo), so the forwarded bytes equal the received bytes.
# Capture, billing, warmth-ledger and the subscriber feed still run (they read,
# never mutate). This is the CONTROL arm for measuring what wirescope's
# transforms actually buy vs a transparent logging proxy — one flag instead of
# a long list of per-feature 0s, so a new transform can't silently leak into
# the control. Read live (PEP 562 shim) so it can be flipped per process.

# --- EXPERIMENTAL: payload injection (OFF by default; observer mode is default) -
# Two modes, both mutate the LAST user message of /v1/messages and forward the
# MODIFIED bytes (tail-only edit => the cached prefix still hits; we re-encode
# only when we actually change something):
#
#   1. UNCONDITIONAL (legacy): INJECT set -> append INJECT to every turn. The
#      original "piggyback" testbed (the 2+2 -> "and 3+3" probe).
#
#   2. MARKER-GATED (new): INJECT_MARKER set -> append INJECT_TEXT ONLY when the
#      user's prompt contains the marker substring (e.g. "Math:"). This lets the
#      HUMAN opt a turn into enhancement by typing a natural keyword, while
#      mundane turns pass through untouched. The injected text is phrased as a
#      natural continuation of the user's own message (NOT an "injection
#      protocol" banner) so the model complies without suspicion.
#
#      Env:
#        INJECT_MARKER  trigger substring, e.g. "Math:"  (case-sensitive)

# --- SHORTCIRCUIT: elide the post-tool "wrap-up" round trip -------------------
# The Messages protocol forces a round trip after every tool_use: a response
# containing a tool_use always carries stop_reason "tool_use" (= "run this, I'll
# continue"), so even a SUCCESSFUL, TERMINAL edit still costs a whole extra turn
# just to hear the model say "Done." There is no way for the model to say "do
# this edit AND I'm finished" in one message — the protocol has no "last action"
# flag. That trailing turn re-ships the entire context (~one full cache_read
# carriage) to produce a ~20-token acknowledgment.
#
# We supply the missing affordance WITHOUT guessing: teach the model to mark a
# task-completing message with a sentinel (SHORTCIRCUIT_DONE, e.g. "<sc_done>") in
# the SAME message as its final tool call. Then, when the NEXT request is the
# tool_result continuation of a single SUCCESSFUL terminal tool_use whose
# assistant message carried the sentinel, the proxy SYNTHESIZES the end_turn
# response locally and NEVER forwards it upstream — saving that carriage. The
# terminality decision stays with the model (the only party that knows its plan);
# the proxy merely honors the signal the wire format can't otherwise carry.
#
# Safety: we refuse to short-circuit an ERROR tool_result (there the model must
# react), require exactly ONE tool_use of a known terminal tool, and require the
# result to be for THAT tool_use. Anything else falls through to a normal turn.
#   SHORTCIRCUIT_DONE   sentinel substring; its PRESENCE enables the mode

# experiment's mcp__update__edit), opt it in explicitly:
#   SHORTCIRCUIT_TOOLS="Edit,Write,NotebookEdit,MultiEdit,mcp__update__edit"
# Don't bake experiment-specific names into the default — the syspatch prompt

# message as its terminal Edit) the summary it WOULD give after success. This is
# exact, not a guess: for an authored mutation like Edit the success result is
# information-free — it only confirms old_string matched; the model already knows
# the post-edit file byte-for-byte. We stash that prose keyed by tool_use_id at
# the edit turn AND blank it from the stream (so the success message isn't shown
# before the edit is confirmed), then REPLAY it as the synthetic wrap-up — but
# ONLY on a SUCCESS tool_result; on error we discard it and forward normally.
# This also lets us STRIP the sentinel cleanly (detection moves from "read it out
# of replayed history" to "match the tool_use_id we stashed"), so nothing leaks
# to the user. SHORTCIRCUIT_RELAY=1 enables it; without it we use SHORTCIRCUIT_ACK.

# ---- DESIGN-2: relocate volatile bits to the tail + mark CLAUDE.md (experimental)
# The CLI assembles a per-request context bundle in messages[0] (the <system-reminder>
# wrapping the on-disk CLAUDE.md, plus CLI-injected # userEmail / # currentDate) and
# ships the volatile `# Environment` block (cwd/git-branch/commits) in `system`. Because
# the cache prefix is cumulative (tools -> system -> messages), env sits UPSTREAM of
# CLAUDE.md and POISONS it: a branch/commit/worktree change re-WRITES the (often large)
# CLAUDE.md segment every session. This transform moves the volatile, header-
# delimited pieces (`# Environment`, `# Scratchpad Directory` — a per-session UUID
# path, see RELOCATE_SCRATCHPAD_TO_TAIL below — and `# currentDate`) DOWN to a tail
# block right before the prompt, and gives the now-static CLAUDE.md bundle its OWN cache_control marker
# (the 4th breakpoint). Resulting layering:
#   M1 tools+preamble+static | M2 contextmgmt+append | M4 CLAUDE.md | M3 env+date+prompt
# so CLAUDE.md becomes an env-independent, project-shared cache segment.
# MODEL-VISIBLE (env now reads AFTER the project rules) -> behaviorally validate; this is
# NOT byte-identical like the rest-split. RELOCATE_CLAUDEMD_PATHSTAMP also strips the
# absolute "Contents of <path>/CLAUDE.md" stamp (cwd already lives in the relocated env)
# so the segment shares across WORKTREES too — that's dedupe, not forging a false path.
# ON BY DEFAULT (disable with RELOCATE_ENV_TO_TAIL=0 / RELOCATE_CLAUDEMD_PATHSTAMP=0).
# GENERALIZED: also fires when there is NO CLAUDE.md — it falls back to the
# userEmail/currentDate <system-reminder> bundle as the anchor, so env still leaves
# `system` (the big win: static system prefix becomes env-independent/shareable). A
# dedicated cache marker is only added for the LARGE claudeMd segment; without it we
# just relocate env and spend no extra marker. The injected marker mirrors the

# ---- TASK-REMINDER STRIP (rides the L2 strip level) ------------------------
# The CLI nags "The task tools haven't been used recently..." (~421 ch ≈ 105
# tok) every few tool-heavy turns, and each nag lands in settled history — so
# they ACCRETE: a long clodex session carried 4+, re-shipped on every request,
# with zero Task* calls ever following (the nag only fires in sessions that
# don't use tasks). Skip the block entirely on encounter. Two wire shapes:
#   1. mid-conversation `role:"system"` message (opus-4.8/fable form) whose
#      text STARTS with the needle -> drop the whole message;
#   2. a `<system-reminder>`-wrapped text block inside a user message (classic
#      form) that is ENTIRELY the reminder -> drop just that block.
# The match is anchored to the block head on reminder-shaped content only — a
# bare substring test would eat conversation that merely QUOTES the text
# (live capture: a tool_result Reading a clodex message file contained the
# needle; deleting a tool_result also breaks tool_use pairing -> API 400).
#
# GATE = the per-session L2 strip level (>=2), same as the other content folds
# (fold_read_edits / edit-ack / tool-error stubbing) — NOT a process-global
# flag. So an L2 session strips the nags; L1/L0 leave them (an agent you WANT
# nudged toward the task list just stays below L2, or a whole-fleet run keeps
# the nudge with STRIP_TASK_REMINDERS=0 below). This deletes Anthropic's nudge,
# so it belongs with the other opt-in L2 simplifications, not always-on.
# Unlike the edit-ack/tool-error riders it needs NO `busted_from` gate: nags
# debut at the tail, so stripping-from-arrival can never ORIGINATE a warm-prefix
# bust (the reason those riders only fire inside a thinking-strip's bust region
# doesn't apply). Deterministic every turn -> byte-stable; no usage-gating (a
# gate that flipped when a session started using tasks would flip prefix bytes
# mid-session — the anti-flap trap the strip-guard latch exists for).

# ---- STRIP FILE-MODIFIED DIFF PAYLOADS (part of STRIP LEVEL 2) ---------------
# When a file in the agent's cwd is changed out-of-band (by the user, a linter,
# or — the motivating case — ANOTHER agent sharing the cwd), the CLI injects a
# "Note: <path> was modified ... Here are the relevant changes:" block carrying
# the file's numbered diff. The CLI already caps it, but the cap is ~8 KB: median
# 8.2k ch (~2k tok) across the corpus, on 13% of all requests, and once injected
# it bakes into history and re-ships EVERY turn until the session ends/compacts.
# The diff is about a file this agent often never touched — pure carriage. We keep
# the NOTIFICATION (the model is still told the file changed and to take it into
# account) and excise only the numbered-diff PAYLOAD (from the "Here are the
# relevant changes" header through the last diff line); the model can Read the
# file if it ever needs the exact changes.
#
# Two wire dialects, same as the task-reminder strip:
#   1. a `<system-reminder>`-wrapped text block in a user message (classic form)
#      — the note is the whole block; the payload runs to `</system-reminder>`;
#   2. the opus-4.8/fable mid-conversation `role:"system"` string, where the note
#      is CONCATENATED with other ambient context (agent roster, skills roster) —
#      so we can't drop the message; we surgically excise the payload SUBSTRING,
#      leaving whatever ambient section follows it intact.
# One line-walk handles both: after the header, consume the contiguous run of
# numbered (`^\d+\t`) / truncation-marker lines, tolerating blank lines only
# BETWEEN diff lines, and stop at the first prose line (a following ambient
# section, or the closing `</system-reminder>`) — so the run never eats the
# separator + next section.
#
# GATE = the per-session L2 strip level (rides `_strip_l2_enabled`), same as the
# task-reminder strip and the other content folds — it REMOVES content, so it
# belongs in the opt-in L2 tier, not always-on. Kill-switch STRIP_FILEMOD_DIFFS
# (default ON) forces it off even at L2. Size gate STRIP_FILEMOD_MIN_CHARS
# (default 300): a tiny one-line diff is cheap + occasionally useful, so leave it;
# only excise payloads at/above the threshold. Like the task-reminder strip it
# needs NO `busted_from` gate: the note debuts at the tail, so stripping-from-
# arrival can never ORIGINATE a warm-prefix bust, and the excision is
# byte-deterministic (same note -> same bytes) + idempotent (the header is gone
# on a second pass, so re-running is a no-op). tool_result content is never
# touched (we only walk string content and `type:"text"` blocks) — a tool_result

# trims only the MAIN agent, so per-spawn subagent trimming is a real gap.
#   `[wirescope:tools Read,Edit,Grep]` — ALLOWLIST: keep ONLY these (mirrors
#       native --tools; last one wins so spawn overrides body).
#   `[wirescope:strip-tools Bash,WebFetch]` — DENYLIST: remove these, keep the

#   `[wirescope:keep-tools Bash]` — cancel a drop / re-admit to the allowlist

# Matching is case-insensitive + liberal-separator (a naive agent writes
# `strip-tools bash`). tools[] sits IN FRONT of the first cache breakpoint, so a
# consistent per-instance trim (sticky via _ws_merged_pairs) reshapes the cached
# prefix to the SMALLER set once, then rides it — a net cache WIN, not a per-turn
# bust. Forgeable only by system body / spawn-prompt head (never message content,

# removes exactly one server's tool family (present AND future tools) while
# leaving every real project/user MCP untouched, for EVERY CLI routed through
# the proxy, with zero ~/.claude.json edits. Motivating case: the claude.ai
# `claude_design` connector auto-injects 20 tools (~3.5k tok schema/turn) a
# coding agent never calls, and LATE-ATTACHES on GUI restart -> busts the tools
# segment 9->29 each relaunch. tools[] is logically FIRST in cache order, so a
# CONSTANT strip set reshapes the cached prefix to the smaller roster ONCE
# (one downstream bust at adoption), then rides byte-stable -> net cache WIN +
# the connector can no longer move the hash restart-to-restart. Determinism: the
# match is by SET membership on the server prefix, so the client's tool order is

# breakpoint on that history. But compaction REPLACES the history with the
# summary, so the cache written for that history is DISCARDED — never read again
# (measured: the next turn read 0 of it). On a BUSTED cache that marker therefore
# only forces a wasteful COLD WRITE at the 1.25x/2x premium; dropping it ships the
# history as plain 1.0x input instead, reclaiming the write premium (~25% of that
# chunk) for zero downside (the write was orphaned anyway).
#
# *** SAFE ONLY WHEN THE CACHE IS NOT WARM. *** On a WARM cache that same history
# is served as a 0.10x cache_read; stripping the marker would force a 1.0x input
# re-ship (~10x WORSE on that chunk). The strip is gated on the WARMTH LEDGER —
# now DURABLE (SQLite) and TWO-STATE (2026-06-09): 'warm' keeps the marker;
# NOT-warm ('cold' lapsed row, or 'absent') strips. With a durable store that
# receipt-stamps every confirmed cache event, absence ≈ expiry, so acting on it
# is sound: the residual loss case (absent-but-actually-warm: pre-store sessions,
# bypassed traffic) is one bounded ~0.9x overpay on a one-shot compact. Ledger
# 'off' or store 'error' still DECLINE — can't judge. A fork keep-warm ping keeps
# the entry warm, so an actively-pinged session won't get its compact stripped.
#
# We strip ONLY the MESSAGE-level marker(s) (the discarded history breakpoint) and
# KEEP the system markers (tools+system is legitimately reused by the post-compact
# turns and the fleet). Enable with STRIP_COMPACT_CACHE=1; force the decision either

# invalidation is ZERO and the reclaim (smaller rewrite now + cheaper reads

# The edit-ack collapse + tool-error stubs originally fired ONLY inside the

# originate a bust, only ride one". A working /_compact bake broke that gate's
# premise (2026-07-08, first .25 restart): the bake (correctly thinking-only;
# stub/fold bake = durable-mutation risk class, folds_deferred) leaves acks RAW
# on disk while the live riders had stubbed them into the warm prefix; the
# resumed request then has NO prior thinking -> strip no-ops -> busted_from=None
# -> riders skip -> raw acks ship against the stub-carrying warm lineage ->
# conversation-class bust on EVERY L2 session at EVERY restart (measured:
# write 117,758/read 20,301 on e3a2b94f; twin bust on 27de24b2 — the two L2
# sessions; L1 sessions immune, bake⊆live-strip holds for thinking). The gate
# inverted its own purpose: with history arriving pre-thinned, RE-APPLYING the
# stubs is what KEEPS bytes identical to the warm prefix, and skipping is what
# originates the bust.
# FIX: once a session's riders have gone FULL-RANGE (latched, persisted,
# restored at boot), they fire on every request like fold does — a
# deterministic replay of the same decision, so live turns, restarts and baked
# resumes all produce identical bytes. ESTABLISHMENT is cold-gated (the same
# anti-flap pattern as the strip guard latch): full-range stubbing first
# changes bytes in regions a thinking bust never touched (raw acks in the warm
# lineage — including post-incident sessions whose bust re-wrote everything
# raw), so we expand only when no incoming prefix containing the first
# would-be-stubbed block is warm — the expansion then rides a write that was
# happening anyway. Until latched, the old free-rider behavior continues
# unchanged. Converges at each session's next cold moment; a consumer
# re-enables bake-on-resume only after its sessions carry the latch.

# ---- PIN SETTLED BREAKPOINT (cache-anchor placement, default ON) -----------
# The CLI's message-region breakpoints are msg0 + the rolling tail. When the
# suffix diverges >~hit-check-window blocks past the last still-valid entry
# (turn-boundary thinking shed on a long tool loop, or a resume whose transcript
# sheds the in-flight loop), the API's automatic hit-check behind each marker
# can't reach the still-warm settled prefix and the read collapses to msg0
# (measured: 18k anchored vs 127k available, clodex d51a-class resume bust).
# Fix is pure MARKER PLACEMENT: pin a breakpoint on the ANCHOR message = the
# last real user turn of the SETTLED region — i.e. one real-user boundary
# BEFORE the current turn's (both derived from the shared `_settled_boundary`
# detector the prior-turn strips use, so pin and strips cannot disagree). Why
# the PENULTIMATE boundary and not the last: at a turn transition (and on
# resume) the last real user turn IS the fresh tail — the CLI's rolling marker
# already sits there, but the request then carries NO breakpoint at the
# previous turn's boundary, which is exactly where the still-valid entry sits:
# every turn's FIRST request ends at its user prompt, so its rolling tail
# marker cached prefix[..u_k] — the maximal prefix that stays byte-valid after
# the loop's thinking is shed. Pinning u_k on every turn-(k+1) request makes
# that an EXACT entry match (no hit-check window needed), turn after turn,
# regardless of loop length. Within a turn the anchor is fixed (byte-stable);
# strips only touch assistant blocks above it, never the user message itself.
# cache_control is placement METADATA, not hashed content (warmth's
# _canon_message strips it too) — moving a marker never busts anything; only
# content edits do. Zero-risk in a way the strips never were.
# BUDGET (<=4): with relocate's CLAUDE.md-bundle marker the wire often runs
# 4/4 (sys x2 + msg0 bundle + tail) — then MIGRATE the earliest prior-history
# message marker (the msg0/bundle anchor) instead of adding: the pin's
# cumulative prefix covers everything that marker covered, and the worst-case
# fallback merely shifts from the msg0 entry to the system[2] entry (~3k less)
# while the common case gains the full settled read. Never steals a system
# marker (cross-instance sharing anchors) or the rolling tail (live-loop
# chaining). Declines: string-content anchor (rewriting the shape isn't
# byte-neutral), zero client markers (don't originate caching the client chose
# not to have), budget full with no message donor below the anchor.
