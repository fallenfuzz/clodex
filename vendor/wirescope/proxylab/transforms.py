# forwarder: the server skips the ENTIRE request-mutation chain (inject /
# shortcircuit / relocate / strip / wirescope omit+tools+hint / sort /
# compact-strip / hold-echo), so the forwarded bytes equal the received bytes.
# Capture, billing, warmth-ledger and the subscriber feed still run (they read,
# never mutate). This is the CONTROL arm for measuring what wirescope's
# transforms actually buy vs a transparent logging proxy — one flag instead of
# a long list of per-feature 0s, so a new transform can't silently leak into
# the control. Read live (PEP 562 shim) so it can be flipped per process.

# --- EXPERIMENTAL: payload injection (OFF by default; observer mode is default) -
# Two modes, both mutate the LAST user message of /v1/messages and forward the
# MODIFIED bytes (tail-only edit => the cached prefix still hits; we re-encode
# only when we actually change something):
#
#   1. UNCONDITIONAL (legacy): INJECT set -> append INJECT to every turn. The
#      original "piggyback" testbed (the 2+2 -> "and 3+3" probe).
#
#   2. MARKER-GATED (new): INJECT_MARKER set -> append INJECT_TEXT ONLY when the
#      user's prompt contains the marker substring (e.g. "Math:"). This lets the
#      HUMAN opt a turn into enhancement by typing a natural keyword, while
#      mundane turns pass through untouched. The injected text is phrased as a
#      natural continuation of the user's own message (NOT an "injection
#      protocol" banner) so the model complies without suspicion.
#
#      Env:
#        INJECT_MARKER  trigger substring, e.g. "Math:"  (case-sensitive)

# trusts as ground truth. No marker, nothing for the agent to know about: it's
# the proxy proactively handing over context the agent would otherwise have to

# --- SHORTCIRCUIT: elide the post-tool "wrap-up" round trip -------------------
# The Messages protocol forces a round trip after every tool_use: a response
# containing a tool_use always carries stop_reason "tool_use" (= "run this, I'll
# continue"), so even a SUCCESSFUL, TERMINAL edit still costs a whole extra turn
# just to hear the model say "Done." There is no way for the model to say "do
# this edit AND I'm finished" in one message — the protocol has no "last action"
# flag. That trailing turn re-ships the entire context (~one full cache_read
# carriage) to produce a ~20-token acknowledgment.
#
# We supply the missing affordance WITHOUT guessing: teach the model to mark a
# task-completing message with a sentinel (SHORTCIRCUIT_DONE, e.g. "<sc_done>") in
# the SAME message as its final tool call. Then, when the NEXT request is the
# tool_result continuation of a single SUCCESSFUL terminal tool_use whose
# assistant message carried the sentinel, the proxy SYNTHESIZES the end_turn
# response locally and NEVER forwards it upstream — saving that carriage. The
# terminality decision stays with the model (the only party that knows its plan);
# the proxy merely honors the signal the wire format can't otherwise carry.
#
# Safety: we refuse to short-circuit an ERROR tool_result (there the model must
# react), require exactly ONE tool_use of a known terminal tool, and require the
# result to be for THAT tool_use. Anything else falls through to a normal turn.
#   SHORTCIRCUIT_DONE   sentinel substring; its PRESENCE enables the mode

# Default = the NATIVE authored-mutation tools only (their results are
# information-free: the model already knows the post-edit bytes, so the wrap-up is
# pure ceremony). To short-circuit a CUSTOM/MCP edit tool (e.g. the mutate-tool
# experiment's mcp__update__edit), opt it in explicitly:
#   SHORTCIRCUIT_TOOLS="Edit,Write,NotebookEdit,MultiEdit,mcp__update__edit"
# Don't bake experiment-specific names into the default — the syspatch prompt

# message as its terminal Edit) the summary it WOULD give after success. This is
# exact, not a guess: for an authored mutation like Edit the success result is
# information-free — it only confirms old_string matched; the model already knows
# the post-edit file byte-for-byte. We stash that prose keyed by tool_use_id at
# the edit turn AND blank it from the stream (so the success message isn't shown
# before the edit is confirmed), then REPLAY it as the synthetic wrap-up — but
# ONLY on a SUCCESS tool_result; on error we discard it and forward normally.
# This also lets us STRIP the sentinel cleanly (detection moves from "read it out
# of replayed history" to "match the tool_use_id we stashed"), so nothing leaks
# to the user. SHORTCIRCUIT_RELAY=1 enables it; without it we use SHORTCIRCUIT_ACK.

# ---- DESIGN-2: relocate volatile bits to the tail + mark CLAUDE.md (experimental)
# The CLI assembles a per-request context bundle in messages[0] (the <system-reminder>
# wrapping the on-disk CLAUDE.md, plus CLI-injected # userEmail / # currentDate) and
# ships the volatile `# Environment` block (cwd/git-branch/commits) in `system`. Because
# the cache prefix is cumulative (tools -> system -> messages), env sits UPSTREAM of
# CLAUDE.md and POISONS it: a branch/commit/worktree change re-WRITES the (often large)
# CLAUDE.md segment every session. This transform moves the volatile, header-
# delimited pieces (`# Environment`, `# Scratchpad Directory` — a per-session UUID
# path, see RELOCATE_SCRATCHPAD_TO_TAIL below — and `# currentDate`) DOWN to a tail
# block right before the prompt, and gives the now-static CLAUDE.md bundle its OWN cache_control marker
# (the 4th breakpoint). Resulting layering:
#   M1 tools+preamble+static | M2 contextmgmt+append | M4 CLAUDE.md | M3 env+date+prompt
# so CLAUDE.md becomes an env-independent, project-shared cache segment.
# MODEL-VISIBLE (env now reads AFTER the project rules) -> behaviorally validate; this is
# NOT byte-identical like the rest-split. RELOCATE_CLAUDEMD_PATHSTAMP also strips the
# absolute "Contents of <path>/CLAUDE.md" stamp (cwd already lives in the relocated env)
# so the segment shares across WORKTREES too — that's dedupe, not forging a false path.
# ON BY DEFAULT (disable with RELOCATE_ENV_TO_TAIL=0 / RELOCATE_CLAUDEMD_PATHSTAMP=0).
# GENERALIZED: also fires when there is NO CLAUDE.md — it falls back to the
# userEmail/currentDate <system-reminder> bundle as the anchor, so env still leaves
# `system` (the big win: static system prefix becomes env-independent/shareable). A
# dedicated cache marker is only added for the LARGE claudeMd segment; without it we
# just relocate env and spend no extra marker. The injected marker mirrors the

# omitClaudeMd, generalized (nothing native removes # userEmail). The directive
# may come from the agent BODY (per-type) or the SPAWN-prompt head (per-call,

# system[2]/messages[0] cache-constant, fires every turn deterministically, and
# is idempotent. messages[0] sits AFTER the system/tools cache breakpoint, so the
# expensive prefix is untouched.
# Default ON: the `[wirescope:omit ...]` directive IS the opt-in (an author must

# ---- MCP SERVER TOOL STRIP (surgical, deployment-level) -------------------
# Drop the tool schemas of named MCP servers from tools[] on the wire, keyed by
# SERVER PREFIX (`mcp__<server>__*`) rather than exact name. This is the
# SURGICAL alternative to the CLI's all-or-nothing `--strict-mcp-config`: it
# removes exactly one server's tool family (present AND future tools) while
# leaving every real project/user MCP untouched, for EVERY CLI routed through
# the proxy, with zero ~/.claude.json edits. Motivating case: the claude.ai
# `claude_design` connector auto-injects 20 tools (~3.5k tok schema/turn) a
# coding agent never calls, and LATE-ATTACHES on GUI restart -> busts the tools
# segment 9->29 each relaunch. tools[] is logically FIRST in cache order, so a
# CONSTANT strip set reshapes the cached prefix to the smaller roster ONCE
# (one downstream bust at adoption), then rides byte-stable -> net cache WIN +
# the connector can no longer move the hash restart-to-restart. Determinism: the
# match is by SET membership on the server prefix, so the client's tool order is
# irrelevant; SORT_TOOLS (downstream) re-alphabetizes the output anyway, so the
# forwarded tools[] is byte-identical every turn. Per-agent escape hatch:
# `[wirescope:keep-mcp claude_design]` re-admits the server for a genuine design
# session (body/spawn directive, same forge-safety as omit/strip-tools).
# Default OFF in CODE (library/test embeddings unaffected); start_proxy.sh turns
# it ON for the lab via STRIP_MCP_SERVERS=claude_design. Kill switch:
# STRIP_MCP_SERVERS="" (or =off).

# only forces a wasteful COLD WRITE at the 1.25x/2x premium; dropping it ships the
# history as plain 1.0x input instead, reclaiming the write premium (~25% of that
# chunk) for zero downside (the write was orphaned anyway).
#

# is served as a 0.10x cache_read; stripping the marker would force a 1.0x input

# now DURABLE (SQLite) and TWO-STATE (2026-06-09): 'warm' keeps the marker;
# NOT-warm ('cold' lapsed row, or 'absent') strips. With a durable store that
# receipt-stamps every confirmed cache event, absence ≈ expiry, so acting on it
# is sound: the residual loss case (absent-but-actually-warm: pre-store sessions,
# bypassed traffic) is one bounded ~0.9x overpay on a one-shot compact. Ledger
# 'off' or store 'error' still DECLINE — can't judge. A fork keep-warm ping keeps
# the entry warm, so an actively-pinged session won't get its compact stripped.
#
# We strip ONLY the MESSAGE-level marker(s) (the discarded history breakpoint) and
# KEEP the system markers (tools+system is legitimately reused by the post-compact

# REMOVAL (not in-place mutation) leaves no signature to verify, so it's clean.
# This changes the message prefix -> BUSTS the message cache from the first
# strip point (one-time per-turn re-cache, recouped by the perpetual cheaper
# reads). MONSTER GUARD: tool-output-dominated histories (body >> thinking) are
# the only money-losers — there the re-cache toll on the busted body outweighs

# paired Edit tool_use). The content removal is deductively safe (no reuse bet, no

# the ack strip ORIGINATES the bust. It only pays as a FREE-RIDER: collapse acks

# earliest stripped index). There the suffix re-writes anyway, so the marginal
# invalidation is ZERO and the reclaim (smaller rewrite now + cheaper reads
# forever) is pure gain. So this is GATED on _strip_prior_thinking having fired,
