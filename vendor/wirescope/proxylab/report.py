"""report.py — `GET /_report?session=<id>`: the per-session cost/efficiency
report. The on-demand, disk-based answer to "where did this session's tokens
(and dollars) actually go, and is it optimal?"

OWNS the quantitative truth a consumer can't safely re-derive: pricing (real
TTL-correct cache dollars from billing.PRICES), the cost decomposition, the
cache-miss detector, the deadweight findings, and the verdict/score. A consumer
(clodex) pulls this lazily behind a "Full report →" link and renders the prose;
the coupling surface is the versioned schema (`report_version`), not my folder
layout — so I can rename a field on disk without breaking the render.

DISK-BASED on purpose (unlike /_context, which reads in-memory last-requests and
goes empty on a cold/ended session): this scans LOG_DIR/<session>/ directly, so
it works on ENDED and historical sessions. Heavy (hundreds of files) → off the
fast poll/admin path; on-demand only, exactly like /_context?utilization=1.

Two internally-consistent views, by design:
  * cost_decomposition — real billing dollars (per-request `billing` blocks,
    summed; NOT response.cumulative, which is GLOBAL across all sessions).
  * token_decomposition — a char-estimate (len/4, same basis as _tool_roster /
    _composition / analyze_tools.py) of where the *tokens* go, model-independent.
The reconciliation invariants (stated in the schema doc): cost buckets sum to
totals.est_usd (± rounding), and token_decomposition.preamble.unused_tokens ==
Σ of the additive deadweight findings' per-turn tokens (same estimate basis).

# Automates the "where did the cache bust" forensics: walk main-line requests
# chronologically and, for each transition, find the FIRST point at which the
# cacheable prefix diverges from the previous turn — in the real cache order
# tools -> system -> messages. A divergence UPSTREAM of the appended tail means a
# cached prefix had to be re-written (a bust); the deeper/earlier it sits, the
# more of the window pays the write toll. The receipt (cache_read vs
# cache_creation tokens) gives the magnitude; the body diff gives the LOCUS.
#
# N-1 is used as the cache proxy for N: the real cache lineage can be an older
# turn or a warm sibling, but the adjacent forwarded body is what changed
# turn-to-turn and is exactly what a human diffs by hand. All comparison is on
# cache_control-STRIPPED canonical bytes (the rolling marker hops to the new last
# message every turn — hashing it would make an unchanged history look changed).
