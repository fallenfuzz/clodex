    level the proxy WILL apply going forward = the per-session override if one is
    recorded, else the deployment global default. When a consumer's POST /_strip
    landed, the override is recorded and `configured_level` reflects it on the very
    next poll; when it didn't land, `configured_level` falls back to the global
    default (here 0) and `source` stays "global_default" — that mismatch is the
    re-POST signal. An explicit override IMMEDIATELY forces the guard latch (the
    setter eats the one-time warm re-cache the consumer asked for), so for an
    override-set session there is NO cold-gated holding-off to fight.

    Do NOT reconcile against the guard: `guard.latched` is the cold-gated
    strip/no-strip DECISION and is only ever held off (`latched:null`) on the
    AUTOMATIC/global path (sessions with no override). Re-POSTing because the guard
    reads null would fight a legitimate cold-gate — and is unnecessary, since
    setting an override resolves the guard immediately. Guard fields are for
    DIAGNOSIS only. `riders_available` = the L2 bundle (read/edit fold + edit-ack/
    tool-error free-rider stubs) is in the configured level; those riders fire
    CONDITIONALLY per turn (only inside a region the thinking-strip already busted),
