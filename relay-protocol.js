// relay-protocol.js — the bytes-on-the-wire commitments for hub-relay DM
// federation. Single, dependency-free source of truth for the two shapes clodex
// blessed (see docs/messaging.md §4 for the prose): the relay ENVELOPE and the
// POST /api/peer/roster payload. Pure functions only — no electron, no fs — so
// both the main-process router (session-manager.js) and the wire layer
// (remote.js / peer-client.js) require it directly, and it's unit-testable
// without a live tunnel.
//
// Topology this serves: a STAR. One hub holds an SSH tunnel to each spoke; spokes
// never dial each other. A spoke→spoke DM is relayed THROUGH the hub — the
// originating spoke enqueues to its own outbox under origin=<hub>, the hub claims
// it and re-delivers to the destination spoke via a plain direct DM.
//
// Two invariants live here and must not be weakened:
//   * `from` is SACRED — fully-qualified end-to-end (`agent@docker`), NEVER
//     rewritten to a hop origin. It is the load-bearing field for the reverse
//     reply path (the destination tags the recipient's sender with it, and the
//     reply re-enters the relay in reverse). Rewriting it breaks replies.
//   * The TERMINAL hub→dest leg is a PLAIN DIRECT DM — the relay fields
//     (`finalTarget`, `hops`, `rv`) are STRIPPED. This is a deliberate
//     loop-prevention feature, not an accident: if the destination agent is
//     offline the dest box sees an ordinary direct DM to a missing local name and
//     parks/bounces it normally — there is no `finalTarget` for it to chase and
//     no way to re-relay. Do NOT propagate `finalTarget` onto the terminal leg;
//     that reopens the loop the `hops<=0` guard and this strip together close.

'use strict';

// Session/label charset — a wire-supplied name/origin/label is only usable as a
